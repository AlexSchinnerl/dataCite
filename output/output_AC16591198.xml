Without assistive technology, people may suffer exclusion, are at risk of isolation and poverty, and may become a burden to their family and on society. There are also socioeconomic benefits to be gained, by virtue of reduced direct health and welfare costs (such as recurrent hospital admissions or state benefits), and by enabling a more productive labour force, indirectly stimulating economic growth [2]. In 2018, a resolution was adopted at the 71st World Health Assembly (WHA71.8) that urged Member States to take concrete actions to improve access to assistive technology. The same resolution requested the WHO to prepare a Global Report on Assistive Technology based on the best available evidence, and make recommendations to the Member States in developing national assistive technology policies and programs to improve access towards universal health and/or social services cover-age [3].Despite the global imperative on improving access to assistive technology, little data has been systematically collected, analyzed, or published to estimate the use, need, met need, and barriers to accessing assistive technology in the population. The development of the WHO-UNICEF Global Report on Assistive Technology published in May 2022 [1] provided an opportunity to fill this gap through a global collaboration in collecting population data in coordinated and standardized method using the WHO rapid Assistive Technology Assessment (rATA) questionnaire [4]. By December 2021, data collection had been completed in 35 countries across the world, with nearly 330000 individuals interviewed in 28 different languages.</description></descriptions><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
