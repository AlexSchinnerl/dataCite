One of the possible solutions to address these developments are innovative technological solutions. An innovative solution could be telemedicine, such as SmartGlass. SmartGlass provides caregivers the possibility to watch and communicate remotely. Due to the covid-19 crisis, the provision of remote care became a necessity, which unexpectedly increased the interest in and the need for use of the SmartGlass by healthcare professionals. This one-year project researched factors that influence implementation of the SmartGlass on the work floor and the perspective of managers and project leaders on the business case. The aim of the project was to implement four use cases: remote triage (screening),wound care, training of students and observation of misunderstood behavior. A mixed-methods approach was carried out. Questionnaires on frequency and duration of use, reason for use, and manageability and functionalities of technology were completed by healthcare professionals (N=110). Individual interviews were held with geriatrics specialists, nurses and psychologists (N=27). Two focus group interviews were held with 8 project leaders and managers. The results of this study indicated positive experiences with the application of SmartGlass technology in long-term care facilities. However, several factors concerning the users, the organization, the technology and the supplier should be taken into account when implementing such a telemedicine intervention, as well as factors that will lead to efficiency gains for a business case.</description></descriptions><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="Conference paper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
