However, people with functional diversity usually present difficulties in speech articulationtoo, one of the most common being dysarthria. Existing commercial ASR systems are not able to cor-rectly understand dysarthric speech, and although some investigation tackling this issue has been conducted, an optimal solution has not been reached yet. Some commercial ASR systems, such as Microsoft Azure Speech to Text, offer a cus-tomization interface where users can train a base model with their speech data and thus improve the recognition accuracy. This paper evaluates the performance of this commercial ASR system when exposed to Spanish dysarthric speech. Re-sults show that, overall, the customized models outperform the basemodels of the system. However, the results were not homogeneous, and even though the recog-nition accuracy improved considerably, the results were far from being as good as those obtained for typical speech.</description></descriptions><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
