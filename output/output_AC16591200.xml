The pandemic posed a wicked problem which defied obvious solutions and had no clear stopping point. In response to the need to sustain contact with disabled people most at risk both of catching the virus and of social isolation, some services developed ad hoc responses. This research explored the practices that staff engaged in to craft that response. Interviews with a purposive sample of twelve staff supporting people with physical, sensory, and intellectual disabilities, across education and training, independent living, information and day services were held between July and September 2020. Four key technological fac-tors weere found to contribute to or inhibit the capacity to innovate: organisational technological capability, access to resources, organisational orientation to understanding the role of technology in people&#8217;s lives and digital literacy skills amongst staff and disabled people. The response is consistent with understanding disability services as Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS), capable of self-organising beyond traditional hierarchies and boundaries, and dynamically adapting to external circumstances to craft unique contextualised responses. The imperative to build on the creative potential of (e)services will rely on sustaining a spirit of openness to innovating in real time and a continuous balancing of potential risks and social inclusion in online spaces. This is likely to be met with success where technology continues to be the tool for engagement rather than an end goal.</description></descriptions><fundingReferences /><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="Conference paper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
