To investigate it, we took the opportunity of a Zoom symposium on our 3D model making and delivering ser-vice. Prior to the symposium we sent out two 3D models to 48 blind and visually impaired attendees without telling what they were. After the symposium, we emailed a questionnaire to them on the understanding of the models and the at-tributes of the attendees, and received the answers from 32 people. The average correct rates for each model were 75% and 50%. The effect of visual, tactile, and hearing experience as well as the age and usage history of hearing and/or tactile senses on the correct rates were examined, but their effects were not explicitly shown by the numbers because of the inadequate research design. Rather, their comments on the grounds for recognition suggest that recognition of 3D models is the conclusion logically drawn by combining a few shape features, and finding these features relies more on prediction than the ability of tactile sense.</description></descriptions><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
