The Sen&#8217;s Capability Approach (CA) recognised the role of wheelchair as an AT product that facilitated access to work and income and attainment of wellbeing. The Capability Approach recognised the need for contextual and environmental AT products and services to address the environmental barriers that limit the Participation of the person with functional difficulties to do what she or he wants (Sen.M, 1980). Sophie Mitra (2006) noted that the Sen&#8217;s Capability approach emerged as a frame that responded to the philosophical question of how to achieve justice for human being and how to measure the standard of living and quality of life of the Person. The research paper analysed how the hearing and Ear assistive technology (HEAT) products and services contributed to the wellbeing of University College Dublin (UCD) students and other HEAT users. The research study methodology was composed of multiple research methods. The mixed research methods such as qualitative and quantitative research methods were used to collect and analyse data. The case study research method was used to examine the data from Ireland. The data shows that UCD HEAT users felt freedom and were happy to have AT products of their choice. Over 80% of the survey participants confirmed that AT contributed to their wellbeing and participation in the different life environments and enabled them to perform activities.</description></descriptions><fundingReferences /><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="Conference paper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
