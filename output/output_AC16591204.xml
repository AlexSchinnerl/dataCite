The Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) recognised the Non-discrimination approach to AT as it stated that the use of Universal Design shall not exclude the assistive technology needed by persons with specific disabilities (UN, 2006; ar-ticle2). The CRPD recognised accessibility as both a human rights principle and a Right under articles 3 and 9 respectively. Assistive technology was also one of the Accessibility and reasonable accommodations recognised by the CRPD. The Multiple research methods composed of case study and mixed research methods were used to collect empirical data on the validation of the Non-discrimination and Accessibility practices and approaches . The qualitative data was collected through key informant interviews. The survey data on the validation of the AT legal and public policies approaches was collected and analysed. The findings reveals that Majority of students were not aware of the AT related public policies and laws. All students recommended the provision of AT based on non-discrimination principle and other CRPD human rights principles. The 2005 Disability Act and the 2015 Equality Acts prohibited discrimination of persons with disabilities in Ireland and provided for reasonable accommodations including provi-sion of AT products and services. Ireland ratified the CRPD in 2018 and committed to the Accessibility and Non-Discrimination approaches and practices. Ireland was a state party to the 2019 European Accessibility Act.</description></descriptions><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
