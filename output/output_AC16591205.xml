In order to provide the platform with an attractive and accepted embodiment, a three-stage approach with potential users is envisaged. This article reports the results of phase 1. Three models with different head and body shapes were evaluated by a younger and an older age group. They were exposed to 3D models they saw in the room through augmented reality glasses. A mixed methods design was chosen: Respondents were asked about each of the models by using open questions in a questionnaire. Additionally, they had to rate the robot in a semantic profile. The potential users preferred a design with a rounded body and an implied face. Tendencies could be seen towards different results in the age groups concerning colour and human likeness. Most people in the younger age group voted for a model with a less humanlike face, while in the older age group a high proportion also chose a model with a human face on a monitor. Changes such as a friendlier expression, a lower height of the robot and a rounder shape of the body seem to be necessary. Involving potential user groups in the process proves useful, as it provides deeper in-sight into their needs. Augmented reality evaluation promises to be a time and material saving method, but further research is needed to validate procedures and results.</description></descriptions><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
