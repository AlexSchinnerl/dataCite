Most assistive products were sourced from the private sector. The majority were paid out-of-pocket and approximately one fifth were supplied through government sources. For adults most assistive products were paid out-of-pocket, while for children most were paid for by the government. Most respondents were very satisfied with their assistive products, AT services and with repair, maintenance, and follow-up. &#8216;Cannot afford&#8217; and &#8216;Lack of support&#8217; were the most frequently identified barriers to accessing assistive products and many reported that the Covid-19 pandemic was a significant barrier to access. The collected data provides useful information on the use of assistive products in the UK. The collected data dispels the myth that assistive products are only for people with a disability. A large-scale questionnaire at national level would be of significant benefit in raising population awareness in the UK.</description></descriptions><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
