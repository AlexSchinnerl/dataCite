This paper explores use, met and unmet need for AT and challenges in accessing AT in the general population in Malawi. Methodology: This study was conducted in Blantyre, Malawi and used WHO&#8217;s Rapid Assistive Technology Assessment methodology. A two-stage sampling design was utilised: 55 and 31 enumeration areas (EAs) in urban and rural Blantyre, respectively, were randomly selected, 25 households were randomly selected per EA. All household members were screened: only those who required or used AT responded to the questionnaire. Cross-tabulations and chi-square test were used to analyse data. Results: In total 2,188 households with 9,485 individuals participated in this survey with 48% males and 63 % urban dwellers. Only 3% of the sampled population used AT while 9% reported needing ATs. The unmet need for AT is highest amongst people with seeing difficulty (65.7%) followed by those with mobility (34.8%) and hearing (23.5%) difficulties. The unmet need for AT increases as the level of functioning difficulty increases. Of the people who reported needing new ATs or their replacements, 61% needed seeing/vision products, 22% needed mobility products while 6.5%, 5.8% and 4.8% needed self-care, cognition and communication products, respectively. The major barrier to accessing ATs is cost (82%), lack of support (19%), unavailability of ATs (10%), ignorance about ATs (4.5%) and lack of transport (3%). Conclusion: While more respondents require AT, only a few use AT. Stakeholders should develop and implement strategies that would improve access to AT not only among persons with disabilities but also in the general population.</description></descriptions><fundingReferences /><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="Conference paper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
