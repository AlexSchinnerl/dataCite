Main focus is to the articles related to the sentiment analysis on the social networks in the Czech or Slovak language. I use the methodology of systemic literature review with a focus on the Scopus and WOS databases and the occurrence of the term sentiment analysis, Czech and Slovak language and social networks in years 2017 to 2021. We found 600 articles related to sentiment analysis, social networks and Czech or Slovak language, where after detailed analysis 5 of them was perfectly relevant to the focus. Texts about using SA for analyzing social networks in Czech or Slovak language are described in the article. There were found and described tools using Machine Learning, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perception, Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, Lexicon based, using universal dictionary and using comparing and translations between Czech and English language. There were some special analysis using Twitter, Youtube and Facebook social networks. There are really few articles on the topic, but they can be found. It is certainly an opportunity for further research.</description></descriptions><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY-NC-ND 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /></resource>
