Despite positive effects, clients and caregivers experience bottlenecks in the daily use of CS. The compliance of clients is low and related to the ability to independently don and doff CS. Studies show that only 37 percent of CS wear-ers can do this independently. If these people do not receive home care or a suitable assistive product, this leads to noncompliance with the risk of complications, reduced autonomy, quality of life (QoL) and increased healthcare costs. Research has shown that by using an appropriate assistive product for donning/doffing, morepeople are able to don or doff their CS independently. The delivery process of these products in the Netherlands is not functioning well and should be opti-mized. As a first step in the optimization, the aim of this study was to identify challenges in the provision process as described in the literature and perceived by all stakeholders. The review detected 13 articles, and 4 national reports were included. The results from a scoping review were supplemented by stakeholders&#8217; experiences shared in personal conversations and an expert meeting. All bottle-necks from the literature were recognized by the stakeholders. Some were added or additional explanations were given to the bottlenecks presented. They can be categorized into 5 main themes; awareness, information provision, competencies, client involvement and reimbursement arrangement. All bottlenecks and explanations form the basis for the optimization of the provision process of assistive products for donning/doffing CS.</description></descriptions><fundingReferences /><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="Conference paper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
