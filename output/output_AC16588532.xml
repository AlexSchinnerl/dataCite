The main symptoms of ADHD are at-tention deficit, hyperactivity and impulsivity, which lead to difficulties for the children in coping with everyday life. In addition, the behavioural problems of affected children also have an impact on the well-being and functioning of the entire family. Due to the dysfunctional family life, parents experience a high stress level. Therefore, parent counselling and family-centred work are of great importance to support families in coping with problematic situations. However, there is a lack of occupational therapy-based support in the home environment for parents of children with ADHD. The study points to the need for an e-coun-selling and e-learning app that meets the demands for appropriate support in the daily life of parents of children with ADHD. Interviews with nine parents of chil-dren with ADHD, one focus group with seven paediatric occupational therapists and two workshops with twelve children with ADHD show the need for an ap-plication that supports parents in daily routines even prior to occupational therapy intervention as well as complements occupational therapy with recommendations for everyday life. Parents and occupational therapists particularly welcome tips for everyday life, information about ADHD and contact addresses for help. Chil-dren stated that improving the skills of preparing meals, doing homework, getting up and going to sleep is most important to them.
