Primary research with two types of questionnaires for employees and employers was conducted from October to December 2021 among 247 employees and 49 employers from different countries and industries. The benefits and drawbacks of RW were revealed. People&#8217;s attitudes toward the organization of RW, work productivity, communication, and trust, as well as people&#8217;s changing expectations of the future of work, were analysed. The findings showed that despite the fact that 57% of employees surveyed had never experienced RW, they easily adapted to the emergency use of working remotely without compromising their work productivity, feeling supported and trusted by their managers. The discrepancies were found between employee-employer perceptions toward the expected changes in the post-covid future of work related to the hybrid office implementation.</description></descriptions><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY-NC-ND 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /></resource>
