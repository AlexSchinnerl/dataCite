Agile methods were initially applied in the software development industry for small project teams following the Agile Manifesto principles and later spread to many other industries. Many studies describe agile methodologies, their threats, benefits for teams and society as a whole, the ability to respond to rigid projects and much more. Still, there are not enough resources for empirical research comparing the success of agile and traditional projects. This study aims to determine whether the use of agile methodologies in project management impacts the overall satisfaction of projects. The study tested this on data obtained from the Pulse meeting, which is used to assess the status of projects at two-week intervals. Almost 1,300 records on the status of a large Czech manufacturing company's 60 most significant IT projects were tested using the Chi-square test. Paper compared the overall status of agile and traditionally managed projects. These findings suggest that the projects that use agile methods have significantly better overall status. Therefore, it can be stated that implementing agile management has a significant benefit. Further, directions for future research are discussed.</description></descriptions><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY-NC-ND 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /></resource>
