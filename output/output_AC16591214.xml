Studies have shown the complexity of access to AT in the country, with people seeking the care they need according to services availability, accessibility, and affordability. However, they used inconsistent approaches to measuring need for and use of AT and presented a lack of relevant information on demand, supply, and user satisfaction. This study aimed at identifying the prevalence of need, access, and use of assistive products (AP), as well as the barriers to access and users' satisfaction with services and products provided to community dwelling people attending rehabilitation services provided by the public healthcare system in S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil. Results show a large prevalence of need for and use of AP, although the unmet need is still high. Private and public sectors are the most relevant sources of products, with private funds being most frequently used to acquire them, despite a large financial barrier. It stressed the importance of the public healthcare system and many of its positive impacts on users, but also some of its limitations, such as service-related barriers. Users are mostly satisfied with the products and services they receive, although people with greater functioning difficulties report a moderately different situation. Hence, the study demonstrated that some user groups still face many barriers and obtain worst results of the system in place. Results are internationally comparable to other studies using similar methodology and demonstrate the impact generated by the local AT provision system.</description></descriptions><fundingReferences /><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="Conference paper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
