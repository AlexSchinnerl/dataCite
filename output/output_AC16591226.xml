This is the result of many intervening and interconnected factors such as lack of awareness, partial accessibility to solutions and services, funding policies and a crucial need of developing and implementing effective service delivery models. The COVID-19 pandemic erupted in early 2020, led to far-reaching consequences for all aspects of society, including the health and welfare systems. In such complex conditions, where many health services are delivered remotely and priorities change, people with disabilities who use Assistive Technology (AT) are likely to be highly effected. It is therefore, that especially during the pandemic, an AT ecosystem, including comprehensive and adaptive service delivery models, must be present to ensure optimal AT access, consultation, provision, and use. This article describes the design and implementation process of a new service delivery model for AT in Israel, that set into action with the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Insights and lessons learned from previous models are highlighted, an outline of the new model is explained, the &#8220;Smart homes&#8221; program, as an exemplary program, is presented, and the interconnecting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the new service model are further explained. Recommendations regarding a hybrid service delivery model for AT are discussed.</description></descriptions><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
