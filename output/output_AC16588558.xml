Toys designed as assistive technologies (ATs) can enhance parental behaviours that benefit play activities and increase family enjoyment. Interprofessional pedagogical strategies can improve the design and implementation of ATs. Aim: This study aims to develop a teaching-learning strategy with the aid of a web-based simulation tool in an AT course that promotes interprofessional skills development through the process of designing a sensory toy for children with disabilities. Method: We used the Significant Learning Framework to guide the implementation of a teaching learning strategy that includes functional knowledge, application, integration, a human dimension, caring, and learning how to learn. We designed an activity with the use of web-based tools and an ad-hoc rubric for quantitative and qualitative hetero- and co-evaluation. Results: Teamwork, interdisciplinary work, and design processes were positively evaluated. Students acknowledged the importance of interdisciplinary cooperation as well as improving the clarity of the disciplinary roles. Co-evaluation showed the need to improve clarity regarding the characteristics of the toy and the pertinence in relation to the user needs. Conclusion: AT design and implementation benefits from interdisciplinary approaches, and experiential learning brings students closer to real needs. The use of technology provides opportunities to materialise dreams and ideas that contribute to the enhancement of accessible and universal design for persons with disabilities.</description></descriptions><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="Conference paper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
