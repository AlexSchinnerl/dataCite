Stakeholders who do not understand information system analysis and software engineering methods need to put significant effort into reading and understanding the business process models created during the initial analysis. The paper presents a novel method of business process analysis and optimization in public administration based on enterprise architecture methods. We developed and pilot-tested the method within two local public administration digital transformation projects in the Czech Republic. We interviewed 21 respondents and devised process cards in a simple tabular format. Substituting detailed process maps in BPMN, decision trees, and state and transition diagrams with process cards, tables, and high-level diagrams in ArchiMate was very well comprehensible for stakeholders in both cases. The paper contributes to the theoretical understanding of the impacts of business process modeling methods on communication and understanding between various stakeholders of digitalization projects. The practitioners such as managers and subject matter experts in public administration may benefit from reduced time spent on the project specification and analysis of business processes.</description></descriptions><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY-NC-ND 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /></resource>
