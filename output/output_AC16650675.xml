The study maps selected changes in the lifestyle of Czechs and Slovaks. Specifically, it focuses on examining changes in the eating habits of customers who have been under the pressure of social distancing and re-closure of the mortar and brick businesses forced to move their interactions dominantly into the virtual world. The concept of food delivery has taken on a new dimension in these conditions, which in combination with companies and services operating based on a shared economy has created completely unique and ideal situation for the renaissance of this sector. The theoretical overview combined with the empirical analysis of the online reputation of the main players in the food delivery industry in the monitored markets compared to the leaders of the industry from the United States created a starting point for the following comprehensive research of the reputation of companies operating in a shared and low carbon economy.</description></descriptions><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY-NC-ND 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /></resource>
