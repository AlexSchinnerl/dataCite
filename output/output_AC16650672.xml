Password strength estimation (PSE) programs can be useful (for the end users and administrators) only if they provide &#8220;a reasonably good&#8221; estimation of password strength. The passwords themselves as well as the tools for their evaluation were tested mainly for English, or other commonly used languages. First, the aim and process of modification of the well-known zxcvbn program suitable for production deployment in the Czech, Slovak or mixed language environment such as at the Prague University of Economics and Business (V&#352;E) is described. Later, the results of password testing without or with zxcvbn are presented. The main findings are: (1) We used a large dataset of more than 3 million previously leaked passwords of about 4.5 million Czech users. The passwords were divided into categories according to the descending frequency. The password strength estimate has improved for all categories. (2) We prepared two equally large randomly selected samples of real hashes of passwords of the users from V&#352;E &#8211; before and after the deployment of the modified zxcvbn. The ratio of broken passwords (using the program John the Ripper) has decreased several times.</description></descriptions><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY-NC-ND 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /></resource>
