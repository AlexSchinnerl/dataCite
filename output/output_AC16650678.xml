Interestingly, while higher education institutions should be natural leaders in promoting sustainability ideas, this is not the case in sustainability reporting. For a long time, higher education institutions lagged far behind corporations. This can be considered alarming because involvement of universities and other institutions of higher education is crucial for sustainable development.But recently the situation has begun to change, and higher education institutions have started to pay more attention to both sustainability management and sustainability reporting. These developments give hope that the ability of universities to produce interdisciplinary professionals capable of meeting the challenges of sustainability will grow.Also, the amount of literature dealing with the issue of sustainability reporting by higher education institutions has started to grow and there is currently no up-to-date bibliometric analysis of this area. This is the gap that this paper seeks to fill. The paper provides a bibliometric analysis of articles indexed in the Web of Science focused on sustainability reporting in higher education. The analysis uses modern tools (Bibliometrix for R) to identify leading journals, influential authors, important articles, and keywords.</description></descriptions><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY-NC-ND 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /></resource>
