We collected responses to the rATA in Costa Rica to determine access to assistive technology. The total sample for this study included 615 individuals, from all ages and geographical areas in Costa Rica, randomly selected among the users of every of the 22-outpatient rehabilitation service of the CCSS. The survey was performed via telephone due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The most important findings include that 68% of individuals reported using AP and 47% of individuals need new or replacement of AP (unmet need). The most used AP were spectacles (34%), therapeutic footwear (10%), and canes/sticks, tripod and quadripod (8%). Most AP (41%) came from the public sector. Out of the total, 39% were paid out-of-pocket 22% were provided by government sources. The main barrier for accessing AP was "Cannot afford" (36%). No association among the setting (urban or rural) with unsatisfied needs was identified, while an increase in the distance travelled to obtain an AP correlated with an increase in unsatisfied needs. An increase in age was associated with an increase in the use of AP. Despite having the possibility to prescribe within the system and provide subsidized products, there is still a high rate of unmet need. Most products need the user to pay for them, with affordability remaining the greatest challenge and distance to travel to obtain an AP remaining as a significant gap in access.</description></descriptions><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
