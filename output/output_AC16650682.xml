They are a means to support the implementation of the 17 UN SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) and the European &#8220;Green Deal&#8221;. The current crisis (climate change, Ukraine war, just to mention a few causes) has shown that our society and economy are not resilient against such critical changes. One of the approaches is to invest much more in circular economy and sustainable modes of production, transport and living, to reduce dangerous dependencies in all industrial and social areas. On the one hand, a severe economic crisis with shortage of essential resources for people worldwide bears risks of social instability and war, on the other hand, mitigation by smart technologies and high automation including autonomous systems bears a considerable risk to democracy, human rights and self-determination as well. European policy has reacted to the challenges of climate change and environmental footprint reduction particularly in context of production, transport, farming and large urban agglomerations &#8211; smartness (intelligence) is not only addressing well-being, assisted living and comfort of citizens (keyword &#8220;Society 5.0&#8221;), but even more sustainability goals in the long term (&#8220;Green and Circular Cities&#8221;).</description></descriptions><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY-NC-ND 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /></resource>
