The interaction of the Disability Models and AT resulted into the Oriented Assistive Technology Service (OATS) delivery systems (AAATE, 2012; Sebastian Van der Peijl and et al, 2011). The AT Medical, Social, Medical-Social, Charity or Donor, Capability, Rights, and Rights + Capability based models or OAT systems emerged as outcome of the interaction between Disability models and AT. These OATS delivery system determined the freedom of choice and decision-making powers for selection of AT products and services between the AT users or Person in need of AT and health, social and other AT related workers. The research study methodology was composed of multiple research methods. The mixed research methods such as qualitative and quantitative research methods were used to collect and analyse data. The case study research method was used to examine the data from Ireland. The data shows that Ireland used the Medical -Social OATS delivery system. The Model provided more decision-making powers for selection of AT products and services to Health and social workers. It provided limited freedom of choice to the AT user or person in need of AT to select AT products and services of choice. Research recommends the use of Rights Capability OAT delivery system. The model provides more decision-making powers to the User or a person in need of AT to select AT products and services of choice.</description></descriptions><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /></resource>
