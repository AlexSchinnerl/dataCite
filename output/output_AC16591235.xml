Prior to the pandemic, most students attended a health care setting to be assessed for their educational technology needs, as funding applications required the recommendations of a therapist or similar professional. Learners with sensory difficulties are able to access recommendations for assistive technology through the Visiting Teacher service, but for those students with physical, intellectual, or neurodevelopmental conditions, healthcare professionals are usually involved in the process of assessment, trialing of solutions and making recommendations [1]. Historically, as part of Enable Ireland&#8217;s Assistive Technology Assessment Support service, learners attended for assessment with parents/guardians, and their primary therapists (Occupational/Speech and Language Therapists mainly) and while information was requested from educational staff, in the majority of cases, they were unable to attend appointments, due to the logistics of cover for their positions, time and travel. With the widespread use of teleconferencing facilities to reduce contacts, and educational staff upskilling in their use of digital technology, an innovative way of including teachers and SNAs in assessments, training, and trialing of as-sistive technology solutions was conceived. Educational staff found it easier to attend assessment appointments using remote platforms such as Microsoft Teams, as cover for their positions was required for a minimal amount of time (45 minutes &#8211; 1.5 hours), that could be sourced within the schools&#8217; own resources. In some cases, the student was present with the teacher while the assessment was conducted, and both the educator and student took a more active part in the assessment process, through the use of discussions, screen sharing to demonstrate apps and software, adjusting inbuilt accessibility options in existing technology etc. If hardware was recommended for trialing, this was provided after the remote session on loan, and reviewed as to its suitability. This paper examines the feedback received from teachers involved in this approach to assistive technology assessment, in particular to see if their participation at this initial stage had implications for the integration of the technology recommended into the student&#8217;s educational experience. It will also look at the training they received in relation to software and apps, and their confidence in applying skills into their work with the students.</description></descriptions><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /></resource>
