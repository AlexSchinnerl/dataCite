There is limited data on access to AT in Indonesia. The rapid Assistive Technology Assessment (rATA) Survey supported by WHO is a strategic contribution capturing the recent situa-tion of AT provision in Indonesia. Method: A crossectional household population-based survey. Cluster sampling was carried out in two stages. First is the random selection of geographic units and the second is a random selection of households within each selected geographic unit. Two provinces, eight districts/cities, 32 sub-districts, 96 villages and 288 RW (block/cluster) were selected. A simple random sample was used for each RW to select 14 households based on the list of households. No specific criteria and characteristics required to become a respondent. Survey data collection carried out using the Survey123 rATA 2020 application. Data collection was conducted in August to December 2021. Results: Total of 11.300 respondents as valid cases consisted of 46.7 % male and 53.3 % female from 72.7% urban and 27.4% rural areas. There are 32.1 % participants have &#8220;any difficulties&#8221; and 12.7% participants have &#8216;a lot of difficulty&#8217; or &#8216;cannot do at all&#8217;. Prevalence of unmet need per level of functional difficulties and for the whole population were quite high. Proportions of different sources for assistive products highlights 74,5 % from private while 6.5 % from public, and 3.8 % from self-made. Proportions of different funding for assistive products explain 64.7 % from out of pocket, 28.2 % from friends/family compare with 3.8 % from government, 1.3 % from NGO, and 1.9 % from insurance. The highest proportions of different barriers to access for assistive products has cap-ture that 51.3 % participants can&#8217;t afford assistive products in Indonesia while 12.4 % has no support. Conclusion: Need of AT is increase with the increase of age. Contribution of government for AT is limited, which made people have to raised self-fund. Affordability of AT is remain a barrier for most people. The research has shown numbers of self-made AT, using local resource material with modest technology. Recommendation: All relevant stakeholder should develop new strategies to improve access to AT, advocate to governments and civil society the unmet needs for AT, provide data to help plan or prioritize AT provision, design and deliver interventions to improve access to AT, evaluate the effectiveness of efforts to strengthen access to AT, and measure progress towards AT targets.</description></descriptions><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="Conference paper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
