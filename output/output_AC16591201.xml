Design: A case series was conducted. Participants: Adults who were being considered for PWC provision and who had been identified by an occupational therapist to benefit from a PWC training were included. Intervention: The COMET intervention a goal directed, client-centered and occupation-based, was provided to all participants. Outcome measures: Clinical applicability indicators were collected for: process, resources, management and treatment. Clinical outcomes included the Goal Achievement Scale (GAS), the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), the Power Mobility Indoor Driving Impairment (PIDA) and the Wheelchair Skill Test (WST). Applicability indicators were evaluated as binary responses (&#8216;successful/unsuccessful&#8217;). Results: Four females (62.5 &#177; 3.5 years) with cognitive impairment participated. Among the thirteen clinical applicability indicators defined, ten were successfully achieved. Indicators that did not meet the criteria for success were adherence rate, safety and treatment for the PIDA. Two of four participants completed all 5 sessions. Two adverse events were reported, with one minor injury. Related to treatment response, participants demonstrated better than expected results on the GAS and the COPM perfor-mance and satisfaction scores. All participants demonstrated improvement of more than 9% at the WST. Only two reported an improvement beyond 4% of the PIDA. Conclusions: With few modifications, the COMET intervention will be applicable in clinical practice. Individuals with complex cognitive and mobility impairment demonstrated abilities to learn PWC use. Further investigation of the COMET intervention is required to evaluate its efficacy.</description></descriptions><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /></resource>
