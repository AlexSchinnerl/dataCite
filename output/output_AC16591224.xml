In 2021 a short taster eLearning course, focusing on primary school assistive technology resources, approximately one hour in duration, was made available free of charge. The course received a positive response, with over 850 enrollees in 8 months, with a completion rate of approximately 20% (average completion rate of self-enrolled courses is 5-15%). This demonstrated that there was a strong appetite for more training and information provision around assistive technology for education. This paper will summarise the development of resources in re-sponse to the above need. Central to Enable Ireland&#8217;s conceptualisation of this eLearning resource was the goal of providing content equally to teachers, special needs assistants and parents. Modules included a focus on mainstream accessibility options; specialised hardware; software; and apps that targeted the principal areas of the primary school curriculum in Ireland. Central to this was inclusion of information on Universal Design for Learning, to ensure that classroom interaction could be adapted for the use of assistive technology by students. The SETT (Student, Environment, Task and Tools) assessment model by Joy Zabala, was described in detail. Content also addressed the areas of Language, Maths, Arts and Physical Education. Uniquely to this assistive technology course was the area of technology for the Irish language. This paper will discuss the design of the course, reviewing content in many different formats, including written, auditory, visual as well as practical tasks to reinforce the knowledge and skills discussed. Accessibility of the course to participants was of a high priority, and efforts were made to ensure that all content was presented in a manner compliant with Universal Design for Learning. Feedback received from participants will also be present and planned changes to the content and format are discussed. The eLearning course can be accessed through the Enable Ireland Moodle website at Learning with Assistive Technology - Primary Level (enableirelandat.ie) (https://enableirelandat.ie/course/view.php?id=48)</description></descriptions><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
