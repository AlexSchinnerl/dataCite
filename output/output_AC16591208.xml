Dynamic arm supports and robotic arms are assistive devices that can support persons with limited upper extremity function in various activities of daily living. To obtain a good match between user and assistive technology and to achieve optimal outcomes with respect to effectiveness, it is essential that the provision process runs smoothly. To inform the development of the optimized provision process, challenges in the current process were investigated from an end-user perspective. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with adult dynamic arm support and robotic arm users. The interview aimed to identify users&#8217; experiences with the provision process, and in particular regarding their awareness of this type of assistive technology, the information provided about the assistive technology and training. Challenges identified in the interviews included: 1) The need to involve experienced occupational therapists in the selection and decision making process. 2) Participants were unaware that this type of assistive technology existed and accidentally came across their dynamic arm support or robotic arm. 3) Referral is guided by previous experiences with a certain assistive technology supplier rather than by the needed functionalities of the device. 4) Too little attention was paid to training or helping participants to get used to their AT. 5) Communication between parties involved in the procurement process and technical assembly is often inadequate.</description></descriptions><fundingReferences /><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="Conference paper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
