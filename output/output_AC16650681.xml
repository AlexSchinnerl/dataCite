COVID-19 pandemic shifted the work landscape, making hybrid and remote workplace settings the standard and putting previously established motivation management tools at risk. Increasing autonomous motivation of software professionals and optimizing multitasking to remain within preferred IT roles might be one approach to overcoming the new obstacles.[Method] Using a quantitative approach, the present study examined the proposed nomological network of software engineering roles, motivation, and personality traits. A conveniently sampled quantitative survey was employed in eight IT companies and two professional IT forums. It produced a considerable (N = 243) data corpus. Based on the state-of-the-art research, hypotheses were formulated, and their statistical counterparts tested by suitable statistical methods, such as the Kruskal-Wallis test. In addition, hierarchical cluster analysis was employed to meaningfully characterize personal differences among software professionals. Finally, correlation analysis was used to derive the strengths of the causal relationships.[Result] Software professionals in this study were of four distinct personality types with varying motivational levels. The openness/intellect dimension was found to significantly nurture motivation in project manager, developer, and analytical roles. In contrast, neuroticism was detrimental to motivation in all roles. The results and future study recommendations were discussed.</description></descriptions><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY-NC-ND 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /></resource>
