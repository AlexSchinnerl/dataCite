The research sample consisted of the 14 largest transport and logistics companies on the Czech market, which were selected based on the ranking of the online review magazine Recenzer.cz. Sentiment analysis was used in the analysis. The findings identified in this significant sample provide one perspective on the issue of sustainable corporate reputation development, primarily in supply chain management and secondarily in all relevant areas of business.</description></descriptions><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY-NC-ND 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /></resource>
