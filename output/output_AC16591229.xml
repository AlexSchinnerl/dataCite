Although the need for Assistive Products (AP) is continue rising, only one in 10 people globally have access the AP they need. Furthermore, there is not sufficient data for AT in many countries around the world yet. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of assessing to AT, need and unmet need of AT, barriers, satisfaction and quality of AT services in Myanmar. Method: A nationwide cross-sectional household survey was conducted from June to August 2021 among 8,209 participants using two-staged cluster sampling methods. Results: In our study 29.4% of the study population needed any type of AP, among which seeing was 26.1% mobility 16.2%, cognition 15%, self-care 13.3%, hearing 9.1%, and 6.4% for communication. The private sector currently used AP accounted for 52.8%, while the public sector contributed only 6.6%. The prevalence of unmet need was 21.5%. It was highest among the elderly. Out-of-pocket payment (67.5%) was the main funding source of AP in Myanmar. Unaffordability was the major barrier to access to AP (38.4%). Majority of the people (66.1%) were satisfied with the assistive products they use. Conclusion: Outcomes of the rATA survey provided key information related to AP in the Myanmar population. Our findings pointed out the importance of formulating and implementing strategies to im-prove the accessibility of AP and enhance the fair financial opportunity for everyone who needs AP.</description></descriptions><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
