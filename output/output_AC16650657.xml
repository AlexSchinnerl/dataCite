The importance of this area increased with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic when most companies had to produce a series of measures that led to at least a partial introduction of work from the home office (HO). In a very short period of time, they faced the dilemma of allowing employees to work from home instead of working within the secure perimeter of the corporate network. These measures have undoubtedly led to a change in the approach of companies and the introduction of new working procedures and tools. For many companies, this has been a general change in the philosophy of human capacity management approaches and a change in processes evaluation The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive best practice overview on how to approach an audit activity on Remote workplace security.</description></descriptions><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY-NC-ND 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /></resource>
