Students with Autism Spectrum Disor-der worked collaboratively to use small coding robots (Ozobots) to solve a vari-ety of problems and tasks. A final task required that they teach students without disabilities to use the Ozobot, taking on the role of an expert. Data were collected using a modified rating scale, modified by the researchers and validated by a panel of experts in the field. The scale included verbal, non-verbal, communica-tion roadblocks, self-control, and relationship measures. The rating scale was completed by the classroom teacher for each participant, before the program and at the conclusion of the program. Combined country results from the pilot pro-grams indicated statistically significant changes in non-verbal communication, self-control, and relationships evident on completion of the program. The teach-ers were interviewed and indicated that many STEM and soft skills were devel-oped throughout the program including curiosity; problem-solving; flexibility; accuracy; social awareness; collaboration; creativity/innovation; responsibility; and persistence. Areas for discussion include the role of the teacher as facilitator of learning, best ways to integrate the coding robots into the curriculum and areas of social skill development that are supported by the use of coding robots.</description></descriptions><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
