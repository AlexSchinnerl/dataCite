This obstacle affects their interactions with creative documents such as literature texts. To reduce these barriers and to improve their daily life, docu-ments can be manually adapted following the Easy-to-Read (E2R) Methodology. As part of our research, a tool that automatically suggests E2R adaptations of micropoems has been developed. In this context, a two-phase user study has been performed using original micropoems in the first phase and their E2R adaptations provided by the aforementioned tool in the second phase. Participants in the study responded a collection of questions of different nature. Since reading causes in general a specific effect in readers, e.g. an emotion, a memory, or a judgement, one of these questions was devoted to know which emotion provokes, on the one hand, the original and, on the other hand, the adapted micropoem. In this paper we present an early analysis of those emotions in order to know whether the E2R adaptation of micropoems has any influence on readers&#8217; emotions.</description></descriptions><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
