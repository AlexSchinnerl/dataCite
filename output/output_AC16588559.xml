People with Intellectual Disabilities (ID) experience much poorer education, health and wellbeing outcomes, exacerbated through their digital exclusion especially during Covid. Digi-ID PLUS is a multidisciplinary pan-European collaborative partnership with people with accessibility needs, disability service user organizations and ad-vocacy groups, education, engineering, health academics and practitioners that addresses the challenge of digital inclusion and digital literacy among people with ID. DigiAcademy is an accessible digital skills e-learning platform co-innovated and co-designed, within the Digi-ID PLUS study, with and for people with accessibility needs to address this digital literacy and access challenge to ensure better health, well-being and inclusion outcomes. We have developed and applied a user-centered de-sign process which is inclusive and iterative and involves the users in all the different phases of the project. In this paper we present our inclusive co-creation process with adults with ID and original findings from our focus group and user testing sessions.</description></descriptions><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
