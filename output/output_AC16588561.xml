Universal accessibility (UA) was recognized in 2006 by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Municipalities play a key role in the implementation of accessible environments but are facing challenges. Adapted and effective knowledge mobilization (KM) strategies are necessary to foster implementation practices of accessible environments. However, we don&#8217;t know much about the strategies used by municipalities, as well as their effectiveness, to mobilize knowledge in the implementation of UA measures. Objective: This project aims to support the municipality of Quebec, Canada, in best practices of KM to improve the implementation of UA measures. Methods and analysis: A case study based on a realist evaluation and a participatory approach will be used. (1)A scoping review was conducted to document strategies used by other municipalities (2)Determinants of implementation will be documented by a questionnaire created from the CFIR. (3)Focus groups will be conducted to co-create KM interventions. The interventions will be implemented and monitored for 12 months. (4)The questionnaire will be retaken to assess the effects of the interventions. Results and discussion: findings of the scoping review outline importance of the involvement of all stakeholders, information sessions and interactive knowledge mobilization strategies to facilitate the implementation. Conclusion: KM strategies adapted to municipal context will actively facilitate the introduction of new evidence to change practices and behaviors regarding UA.</description></descriptions><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /></resource>
