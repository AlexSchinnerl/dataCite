Mainly during June 2021, a nationally representative telephone survey was conducted to collect data through an adapted version of the WHO rapid Assistive Technology Assessment (rATA) questionnaire. Including spectacles, the prevalence of needing at least one assistive product was 68.9% and the prevalence of using at least one assistive product was 68.1%. Excluding spectacles, these prevalence rates were 17.1% and 15.8%, respectively. The access rate was 89.7% including spectacles and 83.2% excluding spectacles. The impact of the pandemic on assistive technology provision appeared to be relatively small.</description></descriptions><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
