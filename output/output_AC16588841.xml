In this paper, we propose a system which recognizes the expiry date in the image automatically and tells them the recognized date. The system is divided into two parts. At first, the system detects the expiry date region from the input whole image. Then, it recognizes the date from the region of the image. In this paper, we focus on the latter part of the system. It consists of a neural network (NN) which inputs the image and outputs the expiry date. The NN consists of 4 convo-lutional layers, 2 max pooling layers and 5 fully connected NNs. We devise the output layer to prevent the output of impossible dates. We corrected 140 images of expiry dates and used 100 images for training and 40 images for testing. The number of the images was not enough for training; therefore, we increased the training images by synthesizing the image. We created total of 100,000 synthe-sized images and used for training and validation. We input 40 images which was not used in training. The result shows that 39 of 40 images were correctly recog-nized.</description></descriptions><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
