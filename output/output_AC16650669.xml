The importance of the circular economy is based on minimising waste raw materials and maximising environmental protection. This paper aims to compare financial indicators for the companies that are affected by the circular economy and companies that are not affected by the circular economy. These indicators were divided into five groups, namely: the area of indebtedness, liquidity, profitability, the area of employment-related indicators and analysis of bankruptcy and solvency models. Significant statistical differences in the indicators of indebtedness, liquidity, and employment-related indicators were found. It was found that companies affected by the circular economy have higher indebtedness. Similarly, these companies have lower liquidity. For the personal cost per employee and average monthly wage, the indicators are higher for the companies that are not affected by the circular economy. The survey shows that it is probably due to more increased investment during the implementation of circular economy elements; the companies affected by the circular economy are more indebted and have higher liabilities, so liquidity is worse. Because of higher costs in depreciation, these companies have a lower profit on the employee.</description></descriptions><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY-NC-ND 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /></resource>
