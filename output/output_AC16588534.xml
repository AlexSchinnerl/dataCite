Under eInclusion aspects public transport plays an important role for them to fulfil their aspirations of self-determined and as much as possible independent living including moving around in one&#8217;s own vicinity as well as travelling to other locations &#8211; even abroad. The eAccessibility of communication content can be a big barrier to such aspirations. The EU project TRIPS (TRansport Innovation for disabled People needs Satisfaction) addresses a broad range of issues in this connection. The low degree of content harmonisation across communication systems and platforms has been identified as a serious development gap in TRIPS Task 3.3 Report on Accessibility Standards and Legislation. This refers to both content entities (mostly of the microcontent type) and the methods to process and manage them.</description></descriptions><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
