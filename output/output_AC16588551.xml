Behavioural changes, such as wandering, sundowning, and agitation, are important predictors for caregiver burnout, with institutionalization of people with dementia as a result. The aim of this study was to gain insight into the challenges people with dementia living at home and their informal caregivers experience during the night, that can contribute to the development of technolog-ical interventions. Semi-structured interviews with people with dementia and their informal caregivers were combined with a focus group with formal caregiv-ers, resulting in an empathy map of people with dementia and their informal car-ers. Improving the knowledge about the importance of good sleep and opening up the discussion about sleep will increase the potential for tackling problems related to sleep for both people with dementia and their carers. Structure in day and night activities, both physical and mental, seem crucial for sleep quality. Also, a person-centred approach in dementia care is evident. Personal habits and behaviours of people suffering from dementia must be collected and well-docu-mented in time, and shared with those involved in determining the person-centred dementia care, and developing supportive technologies.</description></descriptions><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
