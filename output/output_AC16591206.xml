Little is known about the impact and requirements of implementing 3D printing in rehabilitation, including com-petencies of occupational therapists, viable business models and financial, ethical, practical and/or legal considerations. The aim of this study was to explore the perspectives of rehabilitation professionals, 3D printing experts and clients in rehabilitation on the potential of 3D printing technology for manufacturing assistive technology to support activities of daily living. An exploratory qualitative study design was adopted to explore different perspectives on 3D printing for occupational therapy in rehabilitation. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using content analysis. In total, 30 interviews were conducted with users, engineers, health care professionals and (rehabilitation) managers. No clients were found. Participants&#8217; actual experience with using 3D print-ing technology was limited, but they mentioned, knew or used a broad spectrum of 3D printed devices. Participants did see added value for 3D printing of custommade assistive technology. Seven main themes could be identified in the data regarding participants&#8217; views on the implementation of 3D printing in the reha-bilitation setting, including critical factors that should be taken into account: 3D printing technology, mindset, collaboration, competencies, requirements, business case, and legal aspects.</description></descriptions><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="Conference paper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
