The workshops were developed as part of the TRIPS project funded by the Euro-pean Commission. The workshops identified that not all problems required big ideas to resolve. A series of innovations were imagined by people with a disabil-ity to reduce barriers to travel. Some built upon new technology, whilst others took existing ideas and added an inclusive twist. The series of co-design work-shops featured people with a disability, transport operators, and assistive technol-ogy specialists. In each workshop, emerging technologies was introduced to pan-els. Each panel prepared simple design concepts that sought to outline incremen-tal or disruptive innovations to address one or more barriers identified throughout a journey. Designs were prioritized according to feasibility and impact, and a final list was prepared. These were divided into incremental innovations that ad-dressed specific barriers and disruptive innovations that addressed the entire basis of travel and mobility. Often, the most popular and desirable innovations were incremental, building upon current technologies but applying them in new ways. Finding new ways to apply those technologies demonstrated that much was pos-sible. In the examples of incremental innovation, the technology was not a barrier if the will to change was in place. The workshops also explored how to increase access to transport by asking participants to dream and think about &#8220;big&#8221; ideas that would address many of the barriers they faced.</description></descriptions><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="Conference paper" /><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
