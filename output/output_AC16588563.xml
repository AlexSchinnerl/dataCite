The system was capable of transmitting video and audio in very high quality (low latency, sustainable framerate etc.) among all participants, it enabled to transmit more than one video stream of a participant and provided discussion-moderating features. Compared to capabilities of mainstream video-conferencing systems of that time, CoUnSiL 1.0 allowed remote sign language interpreting in the conditions that were very close to interpreting in situ. However, there was a crucial shortcoming of the system &#8211; its setting up was extremely complicated and it had excessive requirements for network bandwidth and network configuration. That is why we started to rebuild the system completely and developed a new one. As it is a web application, no initial setup is needed. It does not require any extraordinary network configuration nor band-width and at the same time, all the features and the quality of video and audio retain on the level of the first version. Moreover, further enhancements and new features have been also implemented &#8211; mainly, the new system is able to transmit a real-time text transcription of speech (speech-to-text reporting service &#8211; captioning) in parallel to sign language interpreting. The feature has been implemented by combining it with our other system &#8211; Polygraf [2]. This has given the video-conferencing system a new name: Polygraf Online [3].</description></descriptions><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /><formats><format>PDF</format></formats><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList></resource>
