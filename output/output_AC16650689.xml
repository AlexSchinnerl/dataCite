Students' engagement with received feedback is considered as important as the delivery of feedback. Nevertheless, feedback in higher education is often criticized by students. But also, teachers are often caught between the quality and extent of feedback and their time resources. The number of students in a module and the social form, whether individual or group feedback, is also a decisive factor. Using feedback within the framework of Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) poses additional challenges. It requires professional competencies and secure handling of the virtual working environment, but design recommendations in this domain are rare. Using the example of two Virtual Collaborative Learning (VCL) modules, each held in collaboration with a partner university, this paper examines the effects of providing formative feedback to students within COIL modules. The investigation is an iterative extension of a prototype of feedback guidelines, which was already published in 2021. The study is based on 126 students&#8217; reflection reports from the years 2019 to 2022 and a total of four modules. With the help of Qualitative Content Analysis, the existing findings in the categories frequency and time, style and tone, recipient and sender, as well as form and content should be expanded and supplemented to understand the engagement of students in COIL modules better and thus to be able to support them in a more targeted manner. In this context, the existing categories serve as a basis for the deductive, inductive mixed coding of the student reflections and thus for the enrichment of the existing categories and the creation of new ones. The beneficiaries are the students, who will be provided with better and more user-friendly feedback, and the teachers, who will have a guideline for providing feedback that will be better accepted by the students and thus lead to a better learning behavior.</description></descriptions><rightsList><rights rightsIdentifier="CC BY-NC-ND 4.0" rightsURI="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode" /></rightsList><resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="ConferencePaper" /></resource>
